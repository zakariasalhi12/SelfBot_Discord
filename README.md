# SelfBot_Discord
## Admin and Manager Check:

The bot can verify if any user has administrative or managerial privileges in the server.
Easily check roles and permissions to ensure proper access control.

ex:
```js
[prefix]check [userid]
```

## Channel Following:

The bot can follow you to any channel within the server.
Automatically join and move to the same voice or text channel you are in, providing seamless assistance and monitoring.

ex: 
```js
[prefix]follow
```
## AFK Mode:

Designate the bot to stay AFK (Away From Keyboard) in a specific channel.
Keep the bot in a chosen channel to maintain a presence or monitor activities without active participation.

ex: 
```js
[prefix]afk
```
